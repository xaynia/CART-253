# Froggy Feast

_A game about a frog catching flies, but more advanced._

## Added Features

- **Title Screen**: Arcade-style title screen. Features:
  - Press 'Enter' to start
  - Instructions: "Move with your mouse, click to catch flies"

- **Game Over Screen**: Displays your score, overall high score, and an option to click to restart.

- **Score Tracking**: Tracks your score throughout the game.

- **High Score Tracking**: Tracks your overall high score.

- **Lives**: Start with 3 lives represented by 8-bit hearts. Lose a life each time you miss a fly. Losing all lives sends you to the game over screen.

- **Increasing Difficulty**: Speed increases with score to progressively raise difficulty.

- **Sticky Fly**: The fly sticks to the frog’s tongue when caught.

- **Fly "Buzzing" Effect**: Sporadic x and y-axis movements create a buzzing effect (especially for the golden fly).

- **Buttons**:
  - **Mute Button**: Mutes and unmutes the music.
