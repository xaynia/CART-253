## Description

This is my 'Art Jam' project for Cart 253.

It is a javascript canvas of my fluffy (and derpy) pomeranian dog, Grizzly, in nature at sunset, where the shy shifts from a sky blue (daytime) to sunset colours, to a midnight blue. At night, it rains shooting stars! Grizzly looks around at the user moving the mouse.

The experience is meant for the user to enjoy Grizzly 'enjoying' the beautiful sunset in nature, and the shooting stars :)
